description: Scaffold and publish a brand-new LOKF knowledge base from an idea — run `lokf new` to create the repo, author the concepts, validate, and publish to GitHub Pages. Use when someone describes a knowledge base they want to exist but there is no repo yet.

# Scaffold a knowledge base from an idea

## Purpose

Go from a one-line idea ("a knowledge base of our data metrics", "my research
group's methods and datasets") to a published LOKF site. This skill scaffolds
the repository, then hands off to `author-concept` / `build-knowledge-base` /
`enrich-relations` to fill it in.

## When to use

- There is no repo yet and someone wants a knowledge base to exist.
- Turning a domain, product, team, or personal corpus into a published,
  queryable knowledge graph *and* website.

## Steps

1. **Scaffold the repo.** Pick a short kebab-case name and, if known, the URL it
   will publish to:

   ```bash
   lokf new my-kb --title "My Knowledge Base" --base-iri https://myorg.github.io/my-kb/
   ```

   This creates `my-kb/` with a starter bundle (`knowledge/`), a full Astro
   site (concept pages + the interactive `/graph` browser + `graph.jsonld`),
   a GitHub Pages workflow, a `justfile`, and these skills under
   `.claude/skills/`. Pass the real published URL as `--base-iri` when known —
   it configures both the concept IRIs and the site's base path.

2. **Understand the domain.** Ask the human what concepts matter and how they
   relate. Sketch the types (`Metric`, `Dataset`, `Table`, `GlossaryTerm`,
   `Service`, `Playbook`, `Tutorial`, `Explanation`, `Document`, `Reference`,
   `Person`, `Organization`,
   `Role`) and the typed relations between them (`measures`, `dependsOn`,
   `derivedFrom`, `isPartOf`, `about`, `memberOf`, …).

3. **Author the concepts.** Delete the two examples under `knowledge/` and use
   the `author-concept` skill to write one file per concept, then
   `enrich-relations` to type the links. Register each concept in
   `knowledge/index.md`.

4. **Validate.** Project the bundle to RDF to confirm it parses and the typed
   relations bind to the right predicates:

   ```bash
   uvx --from lokf lokf convert knowledge --format ttl | tail
   ```

   Preview the website with `just setup && just dev` (concept pages + the
   `/graph` browser); explore with the toolkit via `just serve`; get the
   tabular projection with `just tables`.

5. **Publish.** Confirm `base_iri` in `knowledge/index.md` and `site`/`base` in
   `astro.config.mjs` match the real URL, run `just setup` once and commit
   `package-lock.json`, push to GitHub, and set **Settings → Pages → Source**
   to **GitHub Actions**. The `pages` workflow builds and deploys on every
   push to `main`.

## Done when

- `lokf convert knowledge --format ttl` emits the intended concepts and edges.
- Every concept is listed in `knowledge/index.md`.
- The repo is pushed and the Pages workflow has published the site.
